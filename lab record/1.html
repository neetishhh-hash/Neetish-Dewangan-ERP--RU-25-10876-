  <h1>Ai automation</h1>
  <p>People are taking it lightly but ai automation is going to take over the world. People are saying that if ai will replace them then it is also the truth that if 100 jobs are gonna wanished then only 1-2 jobs are gonna come in those field and that a very less amount of jobs with less packages it's just my thoughts cause no one can predicte the future.</p>

  <h2>Bussiness vs Jobs in this Ai Era</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Ai is a booming industry</strong> with the time it is completely gonna dominate the world and this is the write time to grab this opportunity throung building a bussiness around this cause it new to everyone wheather they are experienced working professinals or a child so it is the right market go get in while on the other side jobs are not that much secure mnc's only want's profits and if theycan reduce there workload thround ai they are definitly gonna layoff thousands of employees it not the time to get a jobs and just think that i am gonna retire by doing this at this time everyday we have to learn and if we don't then no one will be gonna have a bright future.
